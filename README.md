# Background: 
Project Euler is a great way to combine my love for mathematics and programming. I'm currently working through the 5% difficulty portion of the puzzles/challenges. 
More information about Project Euler can be found on the above link.

The overview of each Problem and the output of each Python code can be found within each Python file.
